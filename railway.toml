# Railway: Background Worker for self-feeding learning loop
# https://docs.railway.app/config-as-code
# Uses Dockerfile when present; Root Directory must be repo root (not cloudflare/)
#
# Start command is unified here; which script runs is controlled per service by RAILWAY_START_SCRIPT:
#   - unset or "automate_loop" → Explorer / Exploiter / Balanced (python scripts/automate_loop.py)
#   - "sound_loop"            → Sound workflow (python scripts/sound_loop.py)
#   - "interpret_loop"         → Interpretation (python scripts/interpret_loop.py)
