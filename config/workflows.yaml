# Multi-workflow configurations for Railway / Render / local
# Copy env vars per service when creating multiple workers.
#
# §2.6 Parallel workers: Run Explorer and Exploiter together so completion (coverage) and quality
# (precision) improve in parallel. Both POST to the same API; Explorer fills registry gaps,
# Exploiter reinforces good prompts. See docs/WORKFLOW_EFFICIENCY_AND_REGISTRY_COMPLETION.md.
#
# Two dimensions:
#   1. Prompt choice: explorer (100% explore) | exploiter (100% exploit) | balanced (UI ratio).
#   2. Extraction focus: frame (per-frame / pure static only) | window (per-window blends only).
#   3. Optional: LOOP_STATIC_FOCUS = color | sound | both (when frame: grow only colors, only sounds, or both).
# Set LOOP_EXTRACTION_FOCUS so that 2 workers do frame and 1 does window.
#
# Recommended: Explorer + Exploiter = frame (2 frame workers). Balanced = window (1 window worker).
# For a pure-colors frame worker set LOOP_STATIC_FOCUS=color; pure sounds also have the dedicated sound workflow.
