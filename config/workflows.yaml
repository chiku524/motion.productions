# Multi-workflow configurations for Railway / Render / local
# Copy env vars per service when creating multiple workers.
#
# INTENDED_LOOP dual-workflow design:
#   - Workflow A (interpretation focus): ready for any user prompt; refine known-good.
#   - Workflow B (growth focus): discovery; maximize new values in all three registries.
# Both run the SAME full loop (interpret → create → render → extract → grow → sync).
# The only difference is prompt selection: exploit (reuse good) vs explore (new combos).
#
# Mapping: Explorer = Workflow B focus. Exploiter = Workflow A focus. Balanced = mix.
